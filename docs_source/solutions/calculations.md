# Simple Calculations Solutions

```python

a = 12
b = 18
c = 30

# Add a and b, and check if the result is equal to c.

print(a + b)
print(a + b == c)

# Subtract a from b, and check if the result is not equal to c.

print(b - a)
print(b - a != c)

# Multiply a and b, and check if the result is larger than c.

print(a * b)
print(a * b > c)

# Divide a by 2, and check if the result is smaller or equal to c.

print(a / 2)
print(a / 2 <= c)

# Calculate a to the power of 2, and check if the result is equal to a multiplies by a.

print(a ** 2)
print(a ** 2 == a * a)

# Divide b by 3 and check if the division is without remainder.

print(b % 3)
print(b % 3 == 0)

# Floor-divide b by 4, and check if the result is equal to 4.

print(b // 4)
print(b // 4 == 4)
