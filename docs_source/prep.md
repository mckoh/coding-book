# Preparations

## Step 1: Install Python

In this video, we’ll prepare our computers together and install Python locally. We’ll use the official website python.org for this. By the way, there are also numerous other sources from which you can download Python version 3. If you prefer to use another source, that's perfectly fine too.

We’ll start by downloading the installation program and proceed step-by-step through the installation process. After the installation, we’ll configure our development environment to ensure everything runs smoothly. This is especially helpful for those of you who are new to Python or are setting up a new development environment.

No matter which source you use, the goal is the same: to get Python up and running on your computer and to prepare you for the upcoming lessons. So let's get started and make sure we're well-equipped to get the most out of our Python learning adventures!

## Step 2: Install Development Environment

In this lesson, we will install an integrated development environment (IDE) together, which we can use to write Python code. There are many different development environments to choose from, and if you prefer another environment, you can certainly use that as well.

I will show you step-by-step how to download and set up the IDE. Along the way, I will explain the basic functions and settings you need to know to work efficiently with Python. This introduction is especially helpful for beginners or those looking to improve their current development environment.

No matter which IDE you choose, our goal remains the same: to provide you with the best tools to successfully implement your Python projects. So, let's get started and make sure we are well-equipped for our coding adventures!

## Alternative: Google Colab

In the first two lessons of this series, we learned how to set up Python and an appropriate development environment on our own computers. However, we don't always have access to our own devices. In this video, I will show you a practical alternative that allows you to practice Python without needing to perform an installation. This method is especially useful if you only have access to a tablet and cannot set up a full development environment.
