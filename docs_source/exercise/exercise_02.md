# Exercise 2: String Operations

This is, what you will learn in this exercise:

* Work with operators and strings in Python
* Slice and manipulate strings

## Scenario

Agin, there is no story behind this exercise. Just create two string variables (``a``, and ``b``) and assign the following values:

* `a` is `"YOU ROCK"`
* `b` is `"you rule"`

## Your Task

* Concatenate string `a` and string ``b``.
* Concatenate string `a` and string ``b``, and put a space between them.
* Concatenate string `a` and string ``b``, and put ``" and "`` between them using Python's f-string.
* Repeat string `a` three times with commas and spaces between each repetition
* Print string `b` in capital letters
* Print string `a` in lower case letters
* Check if string `a` ends with "rock"
* Check if string `b` starts with "YOU".
* Capitalize string ``b``.
* Find the position of the space character in string ``a``
* Slice string ``a``, and get the first character.
* Slice string ``a``, and get the first three characters.
* Slice string ``a``, and get the last character.
* Slice string ``a``, and get the last four characters.
* Invert string ``b``.
* Slice string ``a``, getting everything that is left of the space character
