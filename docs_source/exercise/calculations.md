# Simple Calculations

This is, what you will learn in this exercise:

* Use different mathematical operations.
* Use different operators.

## Scenario

Actually, there is no big scenario for this exercise. Just create six variables (a, b, and c) and assign the following values:

* `a` is ``12``.
* `b` is ``18``.
* `c` is ``30``.

## Your Task

* Add ``a`` and ``b``, and check if the result is equal to ``c``.
* Subtract ``a`` from ``b``, and check if the result is not equal to ``c``.
* Multiply ``a`` and ``b``, and check if the result is larger than ``c``.
* Divide ``a`` by ``2``, and check if the result is smaller or equal to ``c``.
* Calculate ``a`` to the power of ``2``, and check if the result is equal to a multiplies by ``a``.
* Divide ``b`` by ``3`` and check if the division is without remainder.
* Floor-divide ``b`` by ``4``, and check if the result is equal to ``4``.
