# Working with Coding Helpers

This is, what you will learn in this exercise:

* Working with conditions.
* Working with loops.
* Handling exceptions.

## Scenario

You are responsible for processing a series of comma separated instructions. Each instruction consists of a direction (u = up, d = down, r = right, l = left) and a number of steps to be taken in that direction. 

Your Instructions are `r3,u2,l1,d1,r2,u3,l2,d2`.

## Your Task

* Write a program that accepts the above list of instructions as a user input object.
* Determine where a game piece will be located on an 8x8 chessboard after all instructions have been processed, starting from the bottom-left corner.
* Handle `IndexError` and `ValueError` exceptions that might occur, if the user passes an incomplete instruction. Find out when these Errors occur and formulate an appropriate message.
