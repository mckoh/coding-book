This is, what you will learn in this exercise:

## Scenario

I found the following image in an exit game that I was playing recently (please ignore my humble pencil marks and excuse the low image quality).

It shows a set of four different symbols, organized in various combinations along four rows and four columns. Each symbol represents a number. We do not know the numeric values behind each symbol, but we know the columns' and rows' sum of values.

## Your Task

* Find the meaning behind the Letters on the bottom
* To do so, build some code finding the numeric values behind each symbol
