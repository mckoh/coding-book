# Working with Loops

This is, what you will learn in this exercise:

* Working with loops.
* Printing to Python console.

## Scenario

Write a program that prints the multiplication table for numbers 1 through 10.

## Your Task

* Use a for loop to iterate through numbers 1 to 10.
* For each number, use another for loop to print the multiplication results for numbers 1 through 10.
* Format the output neatly so that each line shows a complete multiplication result (e.g., '2 * 3 = 6').
