# Exercise 3: Working with Lists

This is, what you will learn in this exercise:

* Working with list iterables in Python.
* Get used to the built-in list methods.

## Scenario

Create two list variables (``a``, and ``b``) and assign the following values:

* `a` is `[2, 4, 6, 1, 2, 3]`.
* `b` is `["a", "b", "a", "a", "b"]`.

## Your Task

* Get the value of the first item in list `a`.
* Get the value of the last item in list `b`.
* Get the values in list `a` in ascending order.
* Get the values in list `a` in descending order.
* Sort list `a` permanently.
* Join the elements of `a` and `b` in pairs.
* Add a new element with value 7 to list `a`.
* Get the value of the first element in list `a` and remove it from the list at the same time.
* Count the occurrences of value `"b"` in list `b`.
* Get the index of the first occurrence of `"a"` in list `b`.
* Get the number of items in list `a`.
* Extend list `a` with the following elements: `[8, 9, 10]`.
* Remove the first occurrence of `"b"` from list `b`.
